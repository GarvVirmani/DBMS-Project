SQL QUERIES TO RETRIEVE DATA:

1.Retrieve details of passengers aged 25.
SELECT * FROM Passengers WHERE age = 25;

2. Retrieve the train details including train ID, train name, source station ID, 
destination station ID, departure time, and arrival time for trains departing 
from the station 'Delhi'.
SELECT t.train_id, t.train_name, t.source_station_id, t.destination_station_id, 
t.departure_time, t.arrival_time
 -> FROM Trains t
 -> JOIN Stations s ON t.source_station_id = s.station_id
 -> WHERE s.station_name = 'Delhi';
 
3. Calculate the total number of passengers booked on each train by counting 
the number of bookings for each train and grouping the results by train ID.
SELECT train_id, COUNT(*) AS total_passengers FROM Bookings GROUP BY 
train_id;

4. Retrieve all details of trains where the train name starts with 'De'.
SELECT *
 -> FROM Trains
 -> WHERE train_name LIKE 'De%â€™;
 
5. Retrieve the maximum available seats for train ID 1 from the Seats table.
SELECT MAX(available_seats) AS max_available_seats FROM Seats WHERE 
train_id = 1;

6. Calculate the average age of passengers from the Passengers table.
SELECT AVG(age) AS average_age FROM Passengers;

7. Delete the booking with booking ID 1 from the Bookings table.
DELETE FROM Bookings WHERE booking_id = 1;

8. Retrieve the train ID, train name, and total available seats by summing up 
the available seats for each train from the Trains and Seats tables, grouped by 
train ID and train name.
SELECT t.train_id, t.train_name, SUM(s.available_seats) AS total_available_seats
 -> FROM Trains t, Seats s
 -> WHERE t.train_id = s.train_id
 -> GROUP BY t.train_id, t.train_name;
 
9. Count the total number of passengers booked on each train for the date 
'2024-05-16', grouping the results by train ID.
SELECT train_id, COUNT(*) AS total_passengers
 -> FROM Bookings
 -> WHERE booking_date = '2024-05-16'
 -> GROUP BY train_id;
 
10. Retrieve all details of passengers from the Passengers table, ordered by 
name in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM Passengers ORDER BY name ASC;
